## üóìÔ∏è Project Overview

This is a project done by Elkhayat, Youssef (myself), a M.Sc student at the University of Munich, Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen. The project was done as part of the praktikum [Sustainable Process Automation](https://www.ph.tum.de/academics/org/cc/course/950733595/) with the [Chair of Information Systems and Business Process Management](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/bpm/chair/) under the supervision of [Mangler, J√ºrgen - Dr. rer. soc. oec.](https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/visitenkarte.show_vcard?pPersonenId=88335AE8FDA7F2B9&pPersonenGruppe=3).

### üìö Project Description

The project was about controlling a mixer connected to a smart socket in a robotic system and showcasing real life scenarios of an orchestration between the robotic arm and the mixer through the BPMs (more on this later).

#### üéõÔ∏è Mixer Control

This was simply done through some APIs provided by a package called [smart-socket-service](https://github.com/ylkhayat/smart-socket-service). Check it out for more thorough explanation of what it can do and how it contributes to the project.

#### ü§ñ UR - Cobot (Cobi)

The robotic arm used in this project was the [UR5e](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur5-robot/) from Universal Robots. The control of the robotic arm was done through the API provided by Universal Robots and all of the programs of the cobot can be found under the [programs directory](./programs).

The design of this task was split into two main functionalities that the robot had to perform:

- **Mixing Process**: The mixing process is defined in the [mixing-process.xml](./mixing-process.xml) file. It includes various endpoints that refer to the UR programs deployed somewhere safe and personally synced in the `programs/` directory.
  - `GlobalToLocal` program consitutes of the following:
    - `Global` is the safe position for Cobi, or referred to as the rest position. Often Cobi is moved to this position when the program is finished or when Cobi is not in use.
    - `Local` is the position where Cobi is ready to operate for our specific installation.
  - `LocalPickupMixer` and `MixerPickupLocal` are the programs that are responsible for Cobi to pick up the mixer, where it is then ready to start mixing, and place it back in its position.
  - `LocalToGlobal` is the program that is responsible for Cobi to move from the local position to the global position.
- **Intensity Process**: The intensity process is defined in the [intensity-process.xml](./intensity-process.xml) file. It tells Cobi which intensity we want to operate our mixer on. The intensity value is set in the `dataelements` section of the XML file.
  - `GlobalToControl` is the program that is responsible for Cobi to move from the global position to the control position.
    - `Control` is the position where Cobi is ready to operate the mixer's intensity (right above the mixer with some defined safe space).
  - `ControlReset` is the program that is responsible for Cobi to reset the intensity of the mixer to zero, to always ensure the setting program to start from zero onwards. (of course this can be done in a more efficient way, to detect the current intensity and move from there accordingly, but for the limited time of the project, we have followed this approach).
  - `ControlSet` is the program that is responsible for Cobi to set the intensity of the mixer based on the `mixerintensity` that we called earlier to set the intensity to the interger input number 6 of Cobi.
  - `ControlToGlobal` is the program that is responsible for Cobi to move from the control position to the global position.

#### üìà Testets

The BPMs are the Business Process Models that are used to orchestrate the robotic arm and the mixer. The BPMs are defined in the [testsets directory](./testsets). The BPMs are used to define the sequence of the tasks that the robotic arm and the mixer have to perform.

Thanks for checking out our project!!
